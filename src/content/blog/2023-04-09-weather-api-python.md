The next program gives you a list of reported weather with latitude and
longitude as inputs. [Repository](https://github.com/cesarcori/weather-api "GitHub Repository").


## Tasks:

1. Find an API Service to gather the information.
2. Get the information from API Service.
    * We use google maps to extract the coordinates of places.
3. Extract only the information that we wanted.
4. Show the information to final user.

Until here the extract information aim is achieved.

Now, just for the peace of my mind. I want a list of coordinates and
integrate it with the program.

5. Create a CSV file with coordinates from places.
6. Put some coordinates in the file.
7. Open the file CSV to extract the coordinates data.
8. Show the information to final user.
9. Avoid wrong enters in the programm.

That's all, go ahead.
