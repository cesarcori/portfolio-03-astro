This is a brief summary and my point of view about the video of
ForrestKnight, (Thanks for this material). 

## Brief summary

Okay, the video start with some of the tasks that it doesn't 
work for Forrest, as: Pomodoro technique and the daily (Scrum).

E.g. the pomodoro technique could lost our concentrations, and the
daily could be boring. What he recommends is "to start yesterday" 
With a plan of what to do tomorrow. That works for him. 

The video conclude with all the work in 4 hour, at the beginning the 
day, because it works for him. 

I was forgetting something, because ForrestKnight says something
valuable about health. All those things don't work well if we 
don't have a good body, or at least take care about it. Referring 
to take sun, walk, exercise, and consume the B12 Vitamina. 

Wow, and one thing more for the last: Try don't overthinking about
deadlines, just start to work and stay in the flow. 

## My point of view

In my opinion, about making a plan at the end of the day. Sometimes I have
so tired to take notes or to plan the next day for a heave day in
the work. I could have to try it, because I heard this from other information 
source. 

I don't consider that daily it has an waste of time, because
as a Scrum says, the main idea to do this is get self-aware about
our decisions and improve our self-organization. 

Possibly when you have a habit about this, it becomes boring. Similar
when you learn the grammar of a language, it's boring, but it takes
you the base main about how you can understand one language. A
similar case happened when I learn to play guitar, first witn no technique, that
takes me more time than when I learn boring techniques and exercises.
It takes me less time than no technique. 

Every knowledge needs a base to understand its big topic. That if
we wanted to understand all about it. 

I have some troubles concentrate for long time 
periodes, because I work with co-workers and sometimes we need
meetings to solve a common problem. It has to be fit for each kind
or developer, because not all has a sun or trees to see (Fortunately
me yes).

I read a book: Deep Work by Cal Newport, when
he says that the most important thing is to have long times to 
concentrate, but concentrate really well. I consider a great material
to help what the video tells. 

About health, I am in sync with this idea. It’s really important
maintain a good body, because we work with our brain, and that is
into our body. That is our asset that we have to take care more
often.

Okay, that was my point of view. If you read until here, I appreciate your 
time, thanks and until the next post!
